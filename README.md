This board was created with the intent to familiarize with the STM8 family of MCUs from ST Microcontroller.
The main features of this board are:

- micro usb power input
- power on led
- user led connected to PB0
- user button connected to PD7
- SWIM programming / debugging interface
- 8MHz High Speed External Clock
- 32.768 KHz Low Speed External Clock
